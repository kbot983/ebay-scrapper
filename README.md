# Project proposal
<!-- My idea is basically to develop a ebay scrapper where you add URLs through HTML and a python script that checks the prices of those products within a specified time. There can be multiple users using these apps and you get a email if  -->
I always wanted to monitor price of certain products I wanted to buy and hence Im coming with a idea where multiple users can add URLs in the system from which my script will check prices of it within a specified period of time and will notify to the users if there was a price change for the item they are tracking via email (I could do text messages too but they cost $$). It will combine PHP and Python with help of MySQL database. As you can see I have started this project but I wanted to do this research for feasibility of project.
